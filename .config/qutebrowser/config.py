# NOTE: config.py is intended for advanced users who are comfortable
# with manually migrating the config file on qutebrowser upgrades. If
# you prefer, you can also configure qutebrowser using the
# :set/:bind/:config-* commands without having to write a config.py
# file.

# Which cookies to accept. With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls
# other features with tracking capabilities similar to those of cookies;
# including IndexedDB, DOM storage, filesystem API, service workers, and
# AppCache. Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are
# supported as per-domain values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-
# unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on QtWebKit will have the same effect as
# `all`. If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets
# applied to the origin/first party URL of the page making the request,
# not the request URL.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - all: Accept all cookies.
#   - no-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only. This is known to break some sites, such as GMail.
#   - no-unknown-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only, unless a cookie is already set for the domain. On QtWebEngine, this is the same as no-3rdparty.
#   - never: Don't accept cookies at all.

# placeholder   expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`). * `{unquoted}` quotes
# nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder   expands to
# `slash/and&amp`).  The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when
# `url.auto_search` is turned on and something else than a URL was

# the search engine name to the search term, e.g. `:open google
